# Rust HCP

This repository serves as an implementation and working definition for the Human Content Protocol and Format. The HCP/F is an opinionated web protocol/format that puts the control over the content back in the hands of the end user. It uses a subset of HTTP(S) as its carrier, JSON/YAML as file formats, and CBOR for communication.
